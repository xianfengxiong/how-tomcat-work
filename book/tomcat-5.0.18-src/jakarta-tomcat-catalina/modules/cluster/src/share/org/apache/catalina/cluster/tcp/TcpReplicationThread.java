     * A worker thread class which can drain channels and echo-back

     * the owning thread pool object. When started, the thread loops
     * forever waiting to be awakened to service the channel associated
     * with a SelectionKey object.
     * The worker is tasked by calling its serviceChannel() method
     * with a SelectionKey object.  The serviceChannel() method stores
     * the key reference in the thread object then calls notify()
     * to wake it up.  When the channel has been drained, the worker
     * thread returns itself to its parent pool.
