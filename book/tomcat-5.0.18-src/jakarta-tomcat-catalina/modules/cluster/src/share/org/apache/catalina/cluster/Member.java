 * The Member interface, defines a member in the Cluster.
 * A member is a Tomcat process that participates in session replication.<BR>
 * Each member can carry a set of properties, defined by the actual implementation.<BR>
 * For TCP replication has been targeted for the first release, the hostname and listen port
 * of the member is defined as hardcoded stuff.<BR>
 * The Member interface together with MembershipListener, MembershipService are interfaces used to
 * switch out the service used to establish membership in between the cluster nodes.
