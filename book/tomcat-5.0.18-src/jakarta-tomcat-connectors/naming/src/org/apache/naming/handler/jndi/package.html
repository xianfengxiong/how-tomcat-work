<h3>Handler</h3>

Objects stored in the directory may have content - and act as a VFS. 

This package deals with accessing files in the directory using URLs.

There are 2 cases:

1. Generic access via InitialContext. We will use a naming structure 
under the InitialContext to locate the file.
  
   jndi:/my/path

will be translated to a lookup for '/my/path'. 

2. The old behavior: the thread is specifically bound to a 
ProxyContext, then this is used to locate files in the particular
webapp. We'll emulate this by treating jndi: as a reference
to a particular branch in the java: webpp resource.
