<h2>Low level management wrappers</h2>

This package provides a Dynamic MBean wrapper to Jk and other components ( tomcat
Interceptors, Ant tasks, etc ) that follow Java Bean setter patterns. 

<p>
It will also provide an abstraction of the config mechanism used - allowing multiple
config repositories to be used, and allowing persistence of the configuration. This 
is not yet implemented - the idea is similar with what happens on jk_config.c, 
i.e. have all configuration done via JMX layer, and have the JMX layer manage
the config file ( eventually via an abstraction layer )

<h3>JkConfig</h3>

This will be the main class for dealing with configs. 
It doesn't depend on JMX - all DynamicBeans will call JkConfig to actually 
set/get parameters on the various components.

It'll manage a tree ( with 2 levels ) represnetation of the config. Each
component will have a node, and we'll store the attribute names and 
( original ) attribute values. Ant-style substitution will happen before 
calling the actual setter. 

Runtime changes will be reflected in the config file. Since we maintain
the tree with whatever the user explicitely configures we don't have to
call getters or guess what has to be stored and what doesn't.

Internally it uses IntrospectionUtil to do all the conversions and magic.

<h3>DynamicMBeanProxy</h3>

This is what JMX sees. It'll make calls on JkConfig for handling the actual
configuration.

XXX Right now it does all the work, we must move it to JkConfig when ready.

<h3>JkHandlerMX</h3>

<h3>ProxyMX</h3>
