/*
 * The web server service 'class'.  An instance of this class is created
 * for each request which is forwarded from the web server to the servlet
 * container.  Contains the basic information about the request
 * (e.g. protocol, req_uri, etc), and also contains a series of methods
 * which provide access to core web server functionality (start_response,
 * read, write).  This class might be more accurately called ws_request.
 *
 * As with all the core jk classes, this is essentially an abstract base
 * class which is implemented/extended by classes which are specific to a
 * particular web server.  By using an abstract base class in this manner,
 * workers can be written for different protocols (e.g. ajp12, ajp13, ajp14)
 * without the workers having to worry about which web server they are
 * talking to.
 *
 * This particular OO-in-C system uses a 'ws_private' pointer to point to
 * the platform-specific data.  So in the subclasses, the methods do most
 * of their work by getting their hands on the ws_private pointer and then
 * using that to get at the correctly formatted data and functions for
 * their platform.
 *
 * Try imagining this as a 'public abstract class', and the ws_private
 * pointer as a sort of extra 'this' reference.  Or imagine that you are
 * seeing the internal vtables of your favorite OO language.  Whatever
 * works for you.
 *
 * See apache1.3/mod_jk2.c and iis/jk_isapi_plugin.c for examples.
