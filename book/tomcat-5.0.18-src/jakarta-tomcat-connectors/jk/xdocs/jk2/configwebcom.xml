    <section name="Intro"><p>Each component instance has a name, that is used for configuration and at runtime. Each component has a number of configurable properties. The following rules are used:
<ul><li>The name is composed from the type and a local part, separated with a ':' ( example: channel.unixsocket:/tmp/jk.socket ) </li>
<li>The 'type' consist of '.' and ascii characters.  It is mapped to a JMX 'domain'.  </li>
<li>The local part consists of ascii characters and .:/; 
<p>Note that '=,' are not currently allowed - a future version may support the jmx syntax by using quotes to separate the local part from the property and value ( in .properties mode we must use '=' to separate the value from type, local name and property name ). </p></li>
<li>The property is a simple name, with no dots. </li>
<li>A simple form of substitution is used in values, where $(property) will be replaced with a previously defined setting. If the property has ':' in it, it'll take the value from the object, if not it'll take the value from a global map.</li></ul></p>

 to match requests to workers, and asociated properties</p>
            <p>If the uri name doesn't have a slash then it is considered as a virtual host
            directive. Uri name can have a virtual host name and(or) port associated with. Format
            of such a name is <b>hostname</b> or <b>hostname:port</b> where hostname
            is virtual server name and the port is vitual server port number. The port number
            is used only for the non default server ports.</p>
            <p>
            Special case is a default server named as <b>[uri:*]</b> that is used when the virtual
            host cannot be found inside the configuration. All the uri directives not containing
            host name belongs to this default server making global mappings.
            </p>
            <p>
            Addition wild char scheme id <b>[uri:*:port]</b> that is used when you wish to
            match any virtual host having specified (non-default) port number, like [uri:*:443].
            This will map all the virtual hosts no mather what is their name but that have port number 443.

                <li>Alias matching host name and port number</li>
