Better SSL support, better ajp14 support


--- pre cvs log ---

20010608 1.0.2 AA

Banished malloc()/free() in favour of jk_pool based memory allocation for configuration data. Added syntax checking and test harness to inifile code.

20010607 1.0.2 AA

Fixed broken SSL detection and started passing any available client certificate through to Tomcat.
			
20010603 1.0.1 AA

Made it work under Linux, which principally involved adding support for reading the configuration from an ini file rather than the registry

20010603 1.0.1 AA

Tidied up configuration file handling, so the code that gets the config items is mostly common for Registry based config and inifile based config
