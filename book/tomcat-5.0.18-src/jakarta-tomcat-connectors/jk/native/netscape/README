ABOUT
-----

The redirector was originally developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, 
so having this environment is a prerequisite if you want to perform 
a custom build on Windows systems

On Unix system, a Makefile.solaris is provided and should be 
adapted to tailor to your own configuration.


REQUIREMENT for Windows build
-----------------------------

MS VC 6.0 (+ update, latest service pack is 5)

BUILDING on Windows
-------------------
 
The steps that you need to take are:

   1. Change directory to the nsapi redirector plugins source directory.

   2. Execute the following command:
      MSDEV nsapi.dsp /MAKE ALL
      If msdev is not in your path, enter the full path to msdev.exe

This will build both release and debug versions of the redirector plugin.

An alternative will be to open the isapi workspace file (nsapi.dsw) in msdev and 
build it using the build menu.
