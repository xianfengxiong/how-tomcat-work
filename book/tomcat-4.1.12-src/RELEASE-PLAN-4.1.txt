                      Release Plan for Apache Tomcat 4.1
                      ==================================


Introduction:
------------

This document is a release plan for the *final* release of Apache Tomcat 4.1.

The goal of the Apache Tomcat 4.1 final release is to provide a stable
container that supports 100% of the mandatory requirements of the Servlet 2.3
and JSP 1.2 specifications, as well as to improve and add many useful 
additional features on top of the existing Apache Tomcat 4.0 releases.

Apache Tomcat 4.1 includes the following major new features over 
Apache Tomcat 4.0:

* JMX based administration features
* JSP and Struts based administration web application
* New Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector
* New Coyote JK2 AJP 1.3 connector
* Rewritten Jasper JSP page compiler
* Performance and memory efficiency improvements
* Enhanced manager application support for integration with development tools
* Custom Ant tasks to interact with the manager application directly 
  from build.xml scripts
* Many other miscanellous improvements

Apache Tomcat 4.1 will use the build numbering and release process first used 
in the Apache HTTPd 2.0.x project.
Milestone builds, numbered 4.1.x, will be released as needed and will 
recieve a stability rating after a one week testing period. The rating can be
either: Alpha, Beta, or Stable.

This Release Plan proposes the following schedule:

  Friday, April 26, 2002          Apache Tomcat 4.1.0

In order to complete final release, all outstanding Bugzilla bug reports
against Tomcat 4.1 above NORMAL severity need to be fixed or deferred for 
later releases.

This Release Plan proposes the following classification of current outstanding
bug reports in the bug tracking system, sorted by component and their ID
numbers in our bug tracking system at:

  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/

Please review the bug reports, and their classification as "must have",
"nice to have", or "address later".  Lobbying for changes in classification
can take place on the TOMCAT-DEV mailing list.  In addition, if you have a
bug report or enhancement that you wish to have considered prior to final
release, please submit a bug report as quickly as possible.
