    <title>The JK 2 Connector</title>
  </properties>

<body>


<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>JK 2 Connector</strong> element represents a
  <strong>Connector</strong> component that communicates with a web
  connector via the <code>AJP</code> protocol.  This is used for cases
  where you wish to invisibly integrate Tomcat 4 into an existing (or new)
  Apache installation, and you want Apache to handle the static content
  contained in the web application, and/or utilize Apache's SSL
  processing.  In many application environments, this will result in
  better overall performance than running your applications under
  Tomcat stand-alone using the <a href="http11.html">HTTP/1.1 Connector</a>.  
  However, the only way to know for sure whether it will provide better 
  performance for <strong>your</strong> application is to try it both 
  ways.</p>

  <p>This connector supports load balancing when used in conjunction with
  the <code>jvmRoute</code> attribute of the 
  <a href="engine.html">Engine</a>.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

  <p>All implementations of <strong>Connector</strong>
  support the following attributes:</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="className" required="true">
      <p>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
      implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.Connector</code> interface.
      You must specify the standard value defined below.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="enableLookups" required="false">
      <p>Set to <code>true</code> if you want calls to
      <code>request.getRemoteHost()</code> to perform DNS lookups in
      order to return the actual host name of the remote client.  Set
      to <code>false</code> to skip the DNS lookup and return the IP
      address in String form instead (thereby improving performance).
      By default, DNS lookups are enabled.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="redirectPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is supporting non-SSL
      requests, and a request is received for which a matching
      <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> requires SSL transport,
      Catalina will automatically redirect the request to the port
      number specified here.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="scheme" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to the name of the protocol you wish to have
      returned by calls to <code>request.getScheme()</code>.  For
      example, you would set this attribute to "<code>https</code>"
      for an SSL Connector.  The default value is "<code>http</code>".
      See <a href="#SSL Support">SSL Support</a> for more information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="secure" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> if you wish to have
      calls to <code>request.isSecure()</code> to return <code>true</code>
      for requests received by this Connector (you would want this on an
      SSL Connector).  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

  <p>The standard implementation of <strong>JK 2 Connector</strong> is
  <strong>org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector</strong>, but you
  must specify the protocolHandlerClassName attribute (see below).</p>

  <p><strong>This implementation supports the AJP 1.3 and 1.4 
  protocols.</strong></p>

  <p>It supports the following additional attributes (in addition to the
  common attributes listed above):</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="acceptCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when
      all possible request processing threads are in use.  Any requests
      received when the queue is full will be refused.  The default
      value is 10.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="debug" required="false">
      <p>The debugging detail level of log messages generated by this
      component, with higher numbers creating more detailed output.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to zero (0).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxProcessors" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of request processing threads to be created
      by this <strong>Connector</strong>, which therefore determines the
      maximum number of simultaneous requests that can be handled.  If
      not specified, this attribute is set to 20.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="minProcessors" required="false">
      <p>The number of request processing threads that will be created
      when this <strong>Connector</strong> is first started.  This
      attribute should be set to a value smaller than that set for
      <code>maxProcessors</code>.  The default value is 5.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="port" required="true">
      <p>The TCP port number on which this <strong>Connector</strong>
      will create a server socket and await incoming connections.  Your
      operating system will allow only one server application to listen
      to a particular port number on a particular IP address.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="protocolHandlerClassName" required="false">
      <p>This attribute value must be 
      <code>org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler</code> to use the JK 2
      handler.</p>
    </attribute>
